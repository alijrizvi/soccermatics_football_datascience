# Mathematical Modeling, Data Analysis, and Predictive Analysis & Modeling of Football (Soccer) Inspired by Dr. David Sumpter's Pioneering Work of Soccermatics


## Background & Overview of Work
It was not too long ago (7-8 months?) that I read Dr. Sumpter's amazing work, his book "Soccermatics", combining his (our) passion for football with his (our) field of Data Science/Mathematical modeling. Since then, I was inspired by his work to incorporate such tools in my own Data Science toolkit as well as have fun with them in our beautiful game. 

So, here is a collection of data collection, organization, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling done for football matches - all was inspired by Dr. David Sumpter's and his colleagues'/guests' teachings through his YouTube channel "Friends of Tracking": https://www.youtube.com/@friendsoftracking755

### The Notebooks/Codebooks & Techniques Applied and Practiced
There are numerous Python codebooks for this project, spanning data scraping, loading-in, and analysis to predictive modeling for the future through Poisson Distribution models, etc. Some higher-level mathematical and data science/machine learning techniques were also practiced on the data, such as Polynomial Regression and OLS Regression.

### Skills and Programming Languages Used
The bulk of the tasks were done using Python (programming language), with one project also done in R and SQL (Magic SQL in Python's environment) each. Lastly, there was also a Poisson Distribution model made in Microsoft Excel, for each match-up between teams of the Premier League from a particular season. In addition to standard data analysis skills and methodologies, statistical techniques like Polynomial and OLS Regression were also applied.
Overall, core tools in a Data Science professional's arsenal were utilized throughout this massive, longitudinal project combining fun and self-improvement - Tableau/Power BI were missed even though Python's data visualization capabilities are no less!
